# Softeng 701 Team 1 (Frontend)

Class Buddy Matcher - Group project for SOFTENG 701 Team 1 (Backend).

This project comprises the frontend segment (user interface) of the Buddymatcher application. It was implemented using the React.js framework, along with Jest and `react-testing-library` for testing the components.

## Prerequisites

- Clone this repository to your local machine. More information on how to do this can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

- Install the latest version of Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
  - Ensure, using `node --version`, that the version is greater than 16.

## Getting Started

In order to run the application, follow these steps.

- Open your terminal and set the working directory to the cloned project on your local machine.
- Follow [this](https://github.com/SE701-T1/frontend/wiki/Environment-Setup) guide on how to setup the environment variables.
- Run `npm install` in your terminal to install the required Node dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the application.

## Linting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for formatting the code. If you are developing on VSCode, you can automate linting using the following steps, so that formatting is automatically done on save.

- Install the _Prettier_ extension.
- Go to settings and set the _Default Formatter_ to 'Prettier - Code Formatter'.
- Enable the _Format On Save_ setting.

If you are using some other text editor, you can go to your terminal and manually run the `npm run lint` command for linting.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
